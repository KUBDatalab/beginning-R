Please note: These pages are under construction! That is a permanent condition,
but at the moment they are under more construction than they will ever be.

We are busy adjusting time-estimates, removing material that will not be covered
in our traing-sessions, and adding material that WILL be covered in our training 
sessions. So - please have patience, we will get there!


The aim of KUB-Datalab is to teach students, teachers and researchers
basic concepts, skills and tools for working with data so they can
get more done in less time. And with less pain.

The lessons below have been cripped from the Data Carpentries lesson
in working with social sciences data in R, but have been scaled down for
time, and adjusted to be generally applicable, in all sciences.

This is an introduction to R, designed for learners with no programming
experience. The lessons can be taught in about 2 to 2Â½ hours. They start
with some basic information on the syntax of R, the interface to RStudio,
and move on to how to import CSV files, the structure of data frames, how 
to manipulate them and calculate summary statistics. 

Logical structures and loops are introduced, and defining your own functions
briefly mentioned.


> ## Getting Started
>
> Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
> their own computers to ensure the proper setup of tools for an efficient
> workflow.
>
> **These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the skills or tools.**
>
> To get started, follow the directions in the "[Setup](setup.html)" tab to
> download data to your computer and follow any installation instructions.
>
> #### Prerequisites
>
> This lesson requires a working copy of **R** and **RStudio**, or access
> to [Rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/).
> <br>To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to install
> everything *before* working through this lesson.
